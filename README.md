node-red-contrib-vonage (beta)
===========================

[Node-RED](http://nodered.org) nodes for Vonage APIs

## Features

- [Voice API](https://developer.vonage.com/voice/voice-api/overview) - Make and receive calls, use text to speech, recording, and DTMF input, forward calls to other destinations
- [SMS](https://developer.vonage.com/messaging/sms/overview) - Send and receive SMS globally
- [Verify](https://developer.vonage.com/verify/overview) - Verify a phone number with SMS and voice fallback
- [Number Insight](https://developer.vonage.com/number-insight/overview) - Get details and formatting of phone numbers

## Account Setup

The first time you use a node you will need to create Vonage authentication parameters.
The SMS, Insight and Verify Nodes simply use your Vonage API key and secret.

The voice API uses a concept of [Applications](https://developer.vonage.com/concepts/guides/applications) that are authenticated with JWTs generated by a private key. This is a little more complex to setup but we've tried to make it as easy as possible in node-red.

## Getting Started

In order to use the Vonage Node-RED package you'll need to [sign-up for a Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up).

Once signed up, grab your API credentials (API key and secret) from the [dashboard getting started page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide).

This video will then walk you through getting started with the Vonage Node-RED package.
